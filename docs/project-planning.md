* Write A Definition Statement <br>
The problem that my product will solve to allow small business owners that provides a type of service requiring clients to easily book sessions per what the business owner states they have available slots.  This will be done by providing an interactive web appliation in the view of a calender.<br><br>
The customer or end user will be incorporated into the process once a prototype is created.  This will allow a foundation to be created and then modified based on critical feedback from what customers already dealing will issues can address.<br><br>
The customer will be involved in the developemtn process afer an intial application has been built.  The calender will be a basic application, then on customer or end user feedback, will be modified to best meet their needs.<br><br>
It's important to incorporate the end user or customer because they have the experience on what works or doesn't work.  More than likely, they have already used several applications similar to this and will know exactly what worked and didn't work.  And on what did not work or appealing to the customer, can be implemented into this application.<br><br>
A technique for obtaining user feedback would be looking for local businesses with something similar already in use, and offering a free trial and feedback.  This will allow real world data and implemetation also while allowing some leeway on functionality.

    1. Some of the options seem too much for a small business. Can be complicated with APIs and Integrations.
